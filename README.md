# React.js Koans

If you want to learn React.js you came into right place. We prepared set of practical exercises that
will help you learn React.js from zero. There is no starting knowledge required. Only thing you need
to know is JavaScript (of course).

You would need to complete given tasks. Prepared test would check if they were done correctly.

## Installation

  1. `git clone git@github.com:arkency/reactjs_koans.git`
  2. `npm run setup`

## Koans structure

 * You need to edit files only in **`exercises`** directory
 * `koans` directory contains sources of all exercises. `test` is for tests.
 * `src` is a contains files compiled from `exercises`
 * `build` contains sources launched in web browser version of Koans.
 
## Start local server (optional)

You can run webserver and see your changes live in your web browser:

  1. Run command `npm run start`
  2. Visit http://localhost:8080/

## Instructions

  1. You should fill code in `exercises` directory and run tests to see if you did everything right.
  2. You must do exercises in given order.
  3. Try to not peak tests files! They contain spoilers.
  4. To run tests, use `npm run test-es6`

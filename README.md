# React.js Koans

If you want to learn React.js you came into right place. We prepared set of practical exercises that
will help you learn React.js from zero. There is no starting knowledge required. Only thing you need
to know is JavaScript (of course).

You would need to complete given tasks. Prepared test would check if they were done correctly.
